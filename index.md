Dear fellow creators,

It was more than 8 years ago when we first got the itch to build PencilCase. We had created many of the tools used in PencilCase to streamline the way we were building custom apps and saw the opportunity to share it with the world.

Since then, Swift, Playgrounds and other tools have changed the way we build things. Instead of shutting PencilCase down, we will be open sourcing it to allow other creators to shape its future.

Look for it in the coming weeks at:

For the remainder of 2018, we will also keep the servers running so you can still keep building.

We'll always be grateful for the part you've allowed us to play in your creations, and we can't wait to see what you're able to do with it.

Until then, keep on makin'!

_The PencilCase Team_
